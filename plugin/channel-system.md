# Channel system

With Capgo and capacitor-updater come a powerful channel system.\


## What you can do with channels:

* Associate devices to channel for developement, beta test or AB testing
* Use one channel by dev branch and let your team self assign from they phone to test



## You have 3 ways to assign device to channel:

* Make the channel default, each time a new device ask capgo for update this one answer
* Send the deviceId to your backend and send from your backend to Capgo the assign order
* Make the channel self assignable, and let the device subcribe to channel ( with user interaction or not)

You can also for specific case assign device directly to a bundle, in debug purpose for exemple.
